        ### Preface

        Projecting moving pictures on a flat surface creates a powerful medium -- the FILM & VIDEO PRODUCT -- that can be used to create art, tell stories, and shape our understanding of the world.

        We must not shy away from the grey areas and overlaps between seemingly separate concepts or entities. By blurring the edges of technology in film and video production, we can open ourselves up to new possibilities and ways of thinking. As digital producers and storytellers, we are committed to using this medium to explore the connections between human beings and promote universal love and unity.

        ### Video as a Dynamic Canvas

        A recording on film or video is not simply a recording of reality. It is a dynamic canvas that can be used to create new worlds and experiences. By manipulating images, sound, and light, we can create artistic artifacts and experiences that transcend the boundaries of time and space.

        ### Co-Creating Reality

        Filmmaking and Videography are powerful tools for co-authoring and co-creating reality. By constructing narratives that share the way we see the world, we can influence the way people think and feel. As digital producers, we have a responsibility to use this power wisely.

        ### Humor as Constructive Deconstruction

        Humor is a powerful tool for deconstruction. It can be used to challenge assumptions, provoke thought, and encourage people to question their beliefs. By incorporating humor into our films, we can create a more open and inclusive space for dialogue and understanding.

        ### Critical Empathy

        Critical empathy is the ability to understand and connect with others, even those we disagree with or consider to be our enemies. By portraying diverse perspectives on film, we can foster empathy among viewers and help them to see the world through different eyes.

        ### Universal Love

        The core tenet of this manifesto is the belief in universal love and unity. We believe that all beings are interconnected and that we all share a common destiny. We are all part of a larger web of life. By exploring the connections between different people, cultures, and ideas, we can build a more just and equitable world. By embracing an ideology of wisdom through discovery, we strive to create a world where peace and understanding prevail.
